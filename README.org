* Emacs interface for Heroku CLI

This package does to Heroku CLI what Magit did to git. It transforms the ~heroku~ commands into useful, quick and intuitive interface using [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]].

* Install
Using ~use-package~ and ~straight~:

#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package heroku
    :straight (:type git :host github :repo "licht1stein/heroku.el"))
#+end_src

* Usage
Make sure that Heroku CLI is installed and you have logged in using ~heroku login~.

Heroku.el has a single point of entry, called ~heroku-list~:

#+begin_src
  M-x heroku-list RET
#+end_src
